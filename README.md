# Artificial Intelligence

This is a repository meant to document my education of Artificial Intelligence through the Udacity AI Nanodegree.

## Part 1

### 1. Build a Game-Playing Agent
![Hidden Markov Models](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/cdn/blob/master/aind/hmm.jpg?raw=true)

Design and implement an agent to play the game of Isolation, a deterministic, two-player game in which the players alternate turns moving between cells on a regular grid till one of them has no more moves left. Use adversarial search with heuristic evaluation functions to overcome computational challenges and make your agent a smarter player.

### 2. Build a Game-Playing Agent
![Heuristics](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/cdn/blob/master/aind/heuristics.png?raw=true)

Solve air cargo logistics problems by decomposing them into individual actions using a formal planning framework, identifying dependencies and effects of each action, and generating valid plans using search techniques. Experiment with various automatically generated heuristics, including planning graph heuristics, and provide an analysis of your results

### 3. Design a Sign Language Recognition System
![Graph Heuristics](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/cdn/blob/master/aind/graph-heuristics.gif?raw=true)

Use Hidden Markov Models to recognize gestures in American Sign Language, from individual words to complete sentences. Train it on a dataset of videos that have been pre-processed and annotated, and test on novel sequences. Improve your recognizer by finding the best English translation of each sentence.
